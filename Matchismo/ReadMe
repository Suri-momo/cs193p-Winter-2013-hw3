Homework #3:

1. Baseline one app that does PlayingCard Match and Set Match - HW #2.

2. Use polymorphism to redesign the controllers.
   Use an abstract base CardGame Controller class that Set and PlayingCard derive from.
   
3. For Set have 12 cards initially dealt and always show what's on them (no face down on these).
   For PlayingCard deal 22 cards face down.
   
4. Support Matches just like in HW #2.

5. When Set Match remove cards from the game and rearrange remaining cards.

6. Core Graphics / UIBezierPath based Set cards - no more attributed strings.
   Integrate PlayingCardView from Lecture 6.
   
7. In Set 'Request 3 More Cards' feature.

8. Auto-scroll for new cards.

9. Provide Set end of deck message.

10. Allow scrolling if more cards than can fit on the screen.

11. Add a 'last flip status' versus the current UILabel for currently selected.

12. Remove flip counter but keep score.

13. Keep 'Deal' button.

14. Use Autolayout to have games work in both Landscape and Portrait in both iPhone 4 & 5.


TO-DO:
Gesture Control to highlight in Set Game and try to match.
Deal Button on Set.
Fix Landscape in Set.
Last Flip Ststus in Set.
Remove Cards when Match Occurs: Set and Match.
